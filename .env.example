# API Configuration
# 
# IMPORTANT: React Native localhost connectivity
# ==========================================
# React Native apps cannot connect to 'localhost' from physical devices
# because it resolves to the device's localhost, not your development machine.
#
# Platform-specific URLs:
# - Android Emulator: http://10.0.2.2:8080
# - iOS Simulator: http://localhost:8080 (works fine)  
# - Physical Device: http://YOUR_MACHINE_IP:8080 (e.g., http://192.168.1.100:8080)
#
# If API_BASE_URL is not set, the app will automatically detect the appropriate
# URL based on the platform. Set this variable to override the auto-detection.
#
# Examples:
# API_BASE_URL=http://10.0.2.2:8080          # For Android emulator
# API_BASE_URL=http://192.168.1.100:8080     # For physical devices (replace with your IP)
# API_BASE_URL=https://your-api-domain.com   # For production
#
API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
API_TIMEOUT=10000
