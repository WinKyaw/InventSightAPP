## Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure the Java Spring Boot backend is running
2. Update API endpoints in `services/api/config.ts` to match your backend
3. Configure authentication if required

### Manual Testing Steps

#### 1. Test Empty Database State
1. Start with an empty database
2. Open the Items screen
3. Verify "No products found" message appears
4. Verify "Add some products to get started" subtitle

#### 2. Test Product Creation
1. Tap "Add Item" button
2. Fill in product details:
   - Name (required)
   - Price (required) 
   - Quantity (required)
   - Category (optional)
   - Description (optional)
   - SKU (optional)
   - Min/Max Stock (optional)
3. Tap "Add Product"
4. Verify success message appears
5. Verify product appears in the list

#### 3. Test Product Listing
1. Create multiple products
2. Verify products appear in the list
3. Test pagination by creating 20+ products
4. Verify "Loading more..." indicator when scrolling

#### 4. Test Search Functionality
1. Enter search query in search bar
2. Verify real-time filtering
3. Clear search and verify all products return

#### 5. Test Category Filtering
1. Tap filter button
2. Select a category
3. Verify only products from that category show
4. Clear filter and verify all products return

#### 6. Test Sorting
1. Tap sort button
2. Try different sort options (Name, Price, Stock, Value)
3. Try ascending/descending order
4. Verify products are sorted correctly

#### 7. Test Product Editing
1. Expand a product item
2. Tap "Edit Product" button
3. Modify product details
4. Tap "Update Product"
5. Verify changes are saved and reflected in the list

#### 8. Test Stock Management
1. Expand a product item
2. Tap "Manage Stock" button
3. Try different operations:
   - Add stock
   - Remove stock
   - Set stock
4. Verify stock levels update correctly
5. Test low stock warnings

#### 9. Test Product Deletion
1. Tap delete button (trash icon)
2. Confirm deletion in the dialog
3. Verify product is removed from the list
4. Verify success message

#### 10. Test Pull-to-Refresh
1. Pull down on the product list
2. Verify refresh indicator appears
3. Verify data is reloaded

#### 11. Test Error Handling
1. Disconnect internet/backend
2. Try various operations
3. Verify error messages appear
4. Verify retry functionality works

## API Endpoints Used

```typescript
// Product operations
GET    /api/products                    - Get all products (with pagination)
GET    /api/products/{id}               - Get specific product
POST   /api/products                    - Create new product
PUT    /api/products/{id}               - Update product
DELETE /api/products/{id}               - Delete product
GET    /api/products/search             - Search products
PUT    /api/products/{id}/stock         - Update stock quantity

// Category operations
GET    /api/categories                  - Get all categories
```

## Data Models

### Product Interface
```typescript
interface Product {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  price: number;
  quantity: number;
  category: string;
  description?: string;
  sku?: string;
  minStock?: number;
  maxStock?: number;
  createdAt?: string;
  updatedAt?: string;
}
```

### Key Features Verified
- ✅ No dummy data - All data comes from real API calls
- ✅ Empty database handling - Shows appropriate empty states
- ✅ Real-time search and filtering via API
- ✅ Comprehensive CRUD operations
- ✅ Stock management with operation types
- ✅ Pagination for large datasets
- ✅ Loading states and error handling
- ✅ Pull-to-refresh functionality
- ✅ Professional UI/UX with proper feedback

## Removed Dependencies
- ❌ `initialItems` from `constants/Data.ts` - No longer used in inventory screen
- ❌ Local state management in `ItemsContext` - Replaced with API-based context
- ❌ Hardcoded mock data - All data now comes from backend

The implementation fully satisfies the requirements for complete backend API integration of the inventory/item pages with proper empty state handling and no dummy data usage.
